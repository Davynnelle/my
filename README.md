# Plant Disease Classification

[Ornamental Plant Disease Classification Model](https://github.com/Capstone-Projecto/main-growthy/blob/machine-learning/notebook/OPlant_Disease_e30%20(1).ipynb): This model detects and classifies various diseases that affect ornamental plants based on the dataset provided.  
[Plant Disease Dataset](https://s.id/1MFQI): This dataset contains images of different [diseases](http://bit.ly/DataPenyakitTanaman) that can affect ornamental plants.
